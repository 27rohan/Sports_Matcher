# Sports_Matcher

1. Pull the code (may take longer than usual) on a MAC
2. Open the Sports_Matcher.xcworkspace file on XCode (please use latest version of XCode to avoid compatibility issues)
3. Either connect an iPhone to your MAC or use a simulator
4. Click on the play-like icon on the top left of your XCode.
5. (Only if testing on iPhone) - allow 'rohan27@uw.edu' as a trusted developer from Settings -> General -> Device Management. Once done, do step 4 again.
